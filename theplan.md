- Page Scanner for suspicious redirects
- model for judging website based on domain name
- portal for reporting fraudulent websites
- measures to prevent spam of reports by rivals of a website

System design(ig)

- Architecture Overview:

  - Frontend: Browser extension interface for users to access features and report fraudulent websites.
  - Backend: Server-side infrastructure to store reported websites, perform fraud checks, and handle user authentication.
  - Database: Store known fraud data, reported websites, user accounts, and logs.

- Components and Features:

  - Browser Extension Components:
  - RAG (Retrieve Known Fraud): Fetch known fraud data and highlight suspicious websites.
  - Page Scanner: Check for suspicious redirects and alert users.
  - Website Judgment Model: Analyze domain names for potential fraud indicators.
  - Reporting Portal Integration: Allow users to report fraudulent websites directly from the extension.
  - Spam Prevention Measures: Implement measures to prevent spam reports by rivals.

- User Flow:

  - Users install the browser extension. -As users browse, the extension scans pages for known fraud, redirects, and evaluates website domains. Users can report suspicious websites through the extension, which are sent to the backend portal.
  - As users browse, the extension scans pages for known fraud, redirects, and evaluates website domains.
  - The backend processes reports, applies spam prevention measures, and stores reported websites. Moderators review reported websites and take appropriate actions.

- Security and Privacy Considerations:

  - Ensure secure communication between the extension and backend servers.
  - Implement strong user authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Encrypt sensitive user data and reported website information.

- Scalability and Performance:

  - Design the backend to handle a large volume of reported websites and user interactions.
  - Use caching mechanisms to improve performance for known fraud retrieval and website judgment evaluation.

- Maintenance and Updates:

  - Plan for regular updates to the extension to include new fraud detection algorithms and features.
  - Monitor user feedback and reported websites to continuously improve fraud detection capabilities.
